You could easily lose yourself — both literally and figuratively — in the endless red sand and towering rock skyscrapers of Wadi Rum. This majestic place, known to even the Greeks and the Romans, has been inhabited for thousands of years and is unlike any other place on Earth. The unique landscape has been featured in a handful of Hollywood movies, for example [_Lawrence of Arabia_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_of_Arabia_(film)) and [_The Martian_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Martian_(film)).
