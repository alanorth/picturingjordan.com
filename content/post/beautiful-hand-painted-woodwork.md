There's an old Syrian man who does this fantastic hand painting on wood panels in Amman. A few flats in our building have them installed on the ceiling, but this one takes the cake. I'm not sure if it's typical for the region or not — the man was referencing pictures from a Russian art book — but they are exquisite.
