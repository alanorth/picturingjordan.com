Alan lived and worked in Kenya for eight years, first as a volunteer teaching computer science at a rural college, and later as a Linux systems administrator at a [livestock research institute in Nairobi](https://www.ilri.org). During his time in Kenya he traveled extensively around East Africa and [blogged about his experiences](https://alaninkenya.org). He is passionate about open-source software, information security, and the freedom of information — naturally, he [blogs about that too](https://mjanja.ch).

After spending some time living in (and [blogging about](https://englishbulgaria.net)) Bulgaria, he finds himself living in Jordan. These are his stories.
