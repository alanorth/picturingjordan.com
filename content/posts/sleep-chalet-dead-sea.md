Jordan's Dead Sea coast is the perfect place to get away from the hustle and bustle of Amman. If you're looking for something a little more wholesome and minimalistic — not to mention cheaper — than an elegant five-star resort, look no further than [Wild Jordan's](https://wildjordan.com/) chalets at Wadi Mujib.

Wild Jordan staff are friendly and genuinely care about nature conservation. Trips to this and other reserves are part of an impressive [government effort](https://www.rscn.org.jo/) to preserve Jordan's natural spaces.
