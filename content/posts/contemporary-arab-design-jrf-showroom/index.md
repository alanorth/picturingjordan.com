The [Jordan River Foundation](https://jordanriver.jo) has a showroom on Rainbow Street where they _brilliantly_ showcase traditional, everyday objects from the region in a fresh, modern way. It's like someone went and replaced all the things in your grandma's rural kitchen with newer, brightly accented ones. All of the wood, cloth, and clay work here is produced by people in local communities, and, as far as I know, the proceeds from sales go back to supporting them.

I commend the [Queen Rania Foundation](https://www.qrf.org/) for another seriously impressive initiative. Keep up the good work!

**Update:** the Jordan River Foundation showroom is now called Jordan River Designs and has moved to Mawloud Mukhalles St. near Fifth Circle.
