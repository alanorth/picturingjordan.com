The best way to describe the Sheikh Zayed mosque would be "the pearl of Aqaba." There is a lot to love about this picturesque mosque by the Jordanian seaside, but its crown jewel — to continue the analogy — is the impeccable Arabic calligraphy inlaid in its façade. Sadly, Aqaba itself [isn't much to write home about]({{< ref "aqaba-dirty-disappointing.md" >}}).

Originally built in 1975, the mosque was refurbished in 2010 as part of a larger effort to revitalize the Red Sea port city and was modeled after the [Sheikh Zayed Grand mosque](http://www.szgmc.gov.ae/en/) in Abu Dhabi.
