While not _technically_ in Jordan, Jerusalem's [Dome of the Rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dome_of_the_Rock) is basically just a stone's throw away from Amman (pun intended). Not only is this shrine capped with a golden dome, covered in vibrant Ottoman-era tilework, and adorned with elegant Arabic calligraphy, it also boasts an [impressive *résumé* of sacred claims to fame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_Stone).

The shrine, built nearly 1,300 years ago, stands atop a hotly contested complex called the [Temple Mount](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_Mount) ("Noble Sanctuary" in Arabic) that dates back to the Canaanites four thousand years ago — like I said, an impressive *résumé*!

As a secular person it's all a bit too heavy for my taste, but there's no doubt that the complex is stunningly beautiful. Visitation of the Temple Mount is open to the non-Muslim public from 7:30 to 11:00 AM from the access bridge at the Western Wall in the Jewish Quarter of the old city.
