I'm ashamed to say that it took me almost one month to discover this sweet, cheesy dessert after moving to Jordan. Originally from [Nablus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nablus), a Palestinian city apparently known for "high cuisine," [kanafeh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanafeh) is one of those things that they just can't make fast enough. At one famous shop called Habibah in downtown Amman there is always a line, and it's even a bit stressful ordering there unless you know what you're doing!

Another good place to buy kanafeh is at a sweets shop called Nafeesah. Both it and Habibah have several shops around the city, but I'm still not sure which one is better.
