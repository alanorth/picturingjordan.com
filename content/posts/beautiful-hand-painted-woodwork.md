There's an old Syrian man who does this fantastic hand painting on wood panels in Amman. Three flats in our building have them installed on the ceiling, but this one takes the cake. I'm not sure if it's typical for the region or not — the man was referencing pictures from a Russian art book — but they are exquisite.
