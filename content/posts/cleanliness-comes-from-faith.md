There is a popular notion that cleanliness is an important part of the Islamic faith, though you wouldn't know it from walking around Jordan. I have never seen people throw coffee cups, half-eaten sandwiches, tissues, etc on the street so carelessly — and often times with such <em>finesse</em> — as here in Jordan.

I saw this graffiti while walking around downtown Amman and thought the irony was too much to not share it. Loosely translated (this apparently comes from the [words, actions, or habits of the prophet Muhammad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadith)), it says "cleanliness comes from faith" (_al-nadafa min al-iman_).
